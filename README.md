# Backlog
The backlog repository is where we keep track of user stories. It is also where we keep general spikes that affect all repositories *e.g. adding github issue template*. Although user stories are kept here,stories sub-tasks should be kept in a specific repository as issues *e.g. If the task is to design a login form for the android app then it should live in [requesttn/request-android](https://github.com/requesttn/request-android/issues)*.
