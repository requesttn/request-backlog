# Backlog
The backlog repository is where we keep user stories and track their progress. It is also used to track progress on *tasks* and *spikes*. Although user stories are kept here, sub-tasks should be kept in a specific repository as issues e.g. If the task is to design a login form for the android app then it should live in [requesttn/request-android](requesttn/request-android).
